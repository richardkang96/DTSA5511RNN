# DTSA 5511 - RNN
This repo includes a project for my Introduction to Deep Learning course, part of University of Colorado Boulder's Master of Science in Data Science program. The goal of the project was to use RNN and NLP to create a model that would predict whether a tweet indicated an actual disaster or not.
